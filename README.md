# Space Weather Data Analysis Tool
## Overview
This tool is designed to simplify and enhance the analysis of space weather data, specifically data retrieved from the OMNIWEB data website. Its purpose is to provide an interactive and easy-to-use framework for processing, analyzing, and visualizing OMNIWEB space weather datasets efficiently.

To ensure that the tool isn't misused or repeatedly downloading the same datasets unnecessarily, the code is encrypted and password-protected. This prevents redundant server requests, ensuring better resource management for users and OMNIWEB alike.
## Features
1. Interactive space weather data analysis for OMNIWEB datasets.
2. Built-in encryption to protect the code and prevent redundant or unnecessary data downloads.
3. User-friendly workflow for accessing and analyzing key datasets, including solar wind parameters, geomagnetic indices, and more.
4. Lightweight and optimized for use in research and educational settings.
## Usage
### Running the Tool
1. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed.
2. Open the tool in your Jupyter Notebook or preferred Python environment.
3. Enter the required password to unlock the script.
4. Load your OMNIWEB dataset or use the pre-built data-fetching functions.
5. Analyze and visualize the data using the built-in features.
