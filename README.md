This tool is designed to simplify and enhance the analysis of space weather data, specifically data retrieved from the OMNIWEB data website. Its purpose is to provide an interactive and easy-to-use framework for processing, analyzing, and visualizing OMNIWEB space weather datasets efficiently.

To ensure that the tool isn't misused or repeatedly downloading the same datasets unnecessarily, the code is encrypted and password-protected. This prevents redundant server requests, ensuring better resource management for users and OMNIWEB alike.
